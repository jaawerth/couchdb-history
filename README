couchdb-history
===============

People's first impression of CouchDB's _rev attribute in its documents is that
they get built in management of their data's history, much like git or svn give
them. Then they find out about compaction and MVCC.

This tool meets that need for them by creating a separate document for each
revision of a document, while allowing them to interface with their data like
normal.
